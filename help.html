    <p>In the US, following legislative changes in 1988, all works (whether they have a copyright
    notice or not) are automatically copyrighted and cannot be used without the author's permission.
    For instance, if you find a shopping list on the floor, you legally cannot publish it without
    the consent of the 'author'.

    The <a 
    href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a>
    use the copyright laws to permit other people to
    use the work, with some restrictions.  The most common restriction is that you should
    <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F"
    >attribute</a> the work to the original author.

    <p>
    The Creative Commons licenses do not require you to inform a creator that you are using her
    CC-licensed work, but it's a nice thing to do. Most people are very happy to learn that someone
    is using and building upon their creations; that's why they use Creative Commons licenses in the
    first place.</p>


    <p>Save the media and the metadata in the same folder.  If you also have the python program
    watch.py monitoring the folder it will do the right thing by renameing the files to what you
    typed in "<code>File name:</code>".
