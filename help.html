    <p>In the US, following legislative changes in 1988, all works (whether they have a copyright
    notice or not) are automatically copyrighted and cannot be used without the author's permission.
    For instance, if you find a shopping list on the floor, you legally cannot publish it without
    the consent of the 'author'.

    The <a 
    href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a>
    use the copyright laws to permit other people to
    use the work, with some restrictions.  The most common restriction is that you should
    attribute the work to the original author.
    </p>
    <p>Save the media and the metadata in the same folder.
    If you also have the python program watch.py monitoring the folder it will do the right thing
    by renameing the files to what you typed in "<code>File name:</code>".
