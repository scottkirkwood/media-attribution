Chrome extension to download a photo or other media and also attempt to save metadata about the image.
Specifically tries to discern the Creative Commons license and author information (although it's not always accurate).

Linux users can run a python program which watches one or more directories and when a .txt file appears it checks if it's a media attribution file and then renames that file plus the associated media so that they are the same.  Requires Python 2.6, Pyinotify, and pyexiv2 is recommended.
